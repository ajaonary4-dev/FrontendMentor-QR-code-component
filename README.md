## My process

The main focus was to center the component vertically and horizontally. Since it was a fixed layout, there were no real need for responsiveness except for minimum width and height

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

## What I learned

Centering a component in the middle of the page. Using basic semantic elements and working a little with Git and Github

## Continued development

I will try to find different ways to center a card or component vertically and horizontally in the middle of the page
